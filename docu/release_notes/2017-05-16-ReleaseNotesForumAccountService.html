<ul>

   <li>Are there changes to the UI?</li>

  <ul>
   <li>What is the reason for the change? User feedback? An error? Continual improvements?</li>
   <li>What are the benefits of the change?</li>
   <li>Who should use the functionality and for what purpose?</li>
   </ul>
 <li>Explains what readers need to do to take advantage of the change.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Do readers need to resubscribe to the package? Migrate to a new version? Back up data files?</li>

<h2>Release note metadata</h2>
Use the metadata at the beginning of this file as a template. For each release note you publish, update the values of the metadata attributes as follows:<br>

<ul>
  <li>**headline**: Provide a concise, descriptive headline that will appear as the name of your release note in the Dev Portal.</li>
  <li>**date**: Enter the date in Month DD, YYYY format as shown at the beginning of this template.</li>
  <li>**service**: Use the name of your service, and nothing else, as the value. The Dev Portal uses this information to display a path at the top of the published release note.</li>
  <li>**official_version**: Enter the current version of your service. Most versions are 'v1' or 'v2'. Services only change versions when an update breaks API compatibility.

</ul>

<h2>Example content</h2>
The following example release note content begins with a descriptive H3-level heading that does not simply repeat the headline metadata, but provides an additional level of insight into the change.<br>

<h3>Manage your online forum user accounts with the new Forum Accounts service</h3>

If you add images to your release notes, place all image files in the docu/release_notes/img directory. This sample directory includes a YaaS.png image file. For images in your other API documentation, however, use the docu/files/img directory. 

## Example image links

To point to image files in your documentation, use relative paths in either HTML or markdown, as shown:

* HTML: <img src="../img/YaaS.png">
* Markdown: ![Alt text](../img/YaaS.png)

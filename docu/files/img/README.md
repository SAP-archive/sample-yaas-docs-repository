If you add images to your documentation, place all image files in the docu/files/img directory. This sample directory includes a YaaS.png image file. For images in release notes, however, use the /docu/release_notes/img directory. 

## Example image links
To point to image files in your documentation, use relative paths in either HTML or markdown, as shown:
 
* HTML: <img src="./img/YaaS.png">
* Markdown: ![Alt text](./img/YaaS.png")
